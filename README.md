# Intelligent Patient–Doctor Matching ML

An intelligent machine learning system designed to match patients with appropriate doctors through automated data preprocessing, classification modeling, insightful visualizations, and PDF reporting.

## 🚀 Features

- Intelligent matching of patients and doctors using ML algorithms
- Automated data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering for improved model accuracy
- Classification-based matching using Decision Trees and LightGBM
- Result visualization (confusion matrix, feature importance, etc.)
- PDF report generation for matched pairs
- Modular structure ready for integration into web APIs (e.g., FastAPI)

## 📁 Files

- `Matching_intelligent_system.ipynb` – main Jupyter Notebook implementing the pipeline
- `requirements.txt` – list of required Python packages

## ⚙️ Installation
